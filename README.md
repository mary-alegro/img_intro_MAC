Material for the Intro to Image Processing MAC lecture

For those who want to follow along, you'll need to bring a laptop with Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed. I recommend using Anaconda since it comes out of the box with most of the necessary libraries:


1) Install Python

Windows users can install Anaconda following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbYGBANqDdY

Mac users can install Anaconda following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N165LUKrHv4

2) Install NiBabel

You'll also need to install NiBabel for the tutorial: In Anaconda, open a Terminal window and type pip install nibabel. More information in: https://nipy.org/nibabel/installation.html


3) Get familiar with Jupyter Notebook

If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, here is a very useful 30 minutes crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk

I'll upload the lecture material to Github tomorrow morning. You can clone it using git on download it from the repo website: https://github.com/mary-alegro/img_intro_MAC
